			application and consist of servlets, jsp and html pages which creates
			home page, my resume page, BigBox application page where user can
			view list of stores, divisions, users, registration and login page.
			It has User, Division, Store and Store Sales classes stored into
			their respective packages.It implements the DAO Factory Pattern and
			stores and gets the data from PLSql (PGAdmin) Database, converted
			from MYSQL database to deploy on Heroku. Since this project is a
			Dynamic web application User can access it online via URL and can
